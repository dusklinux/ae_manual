lesson('install','01 · Install, identify and prepare AE 25.6','START',
'Use the specified 25.6 build on Windows, with a reproducible workspace and no accidental version mismatch.', '''
Open Creative Cloud Desktop on Windows. Locate After Effects and check the installed version through Help → About After Effects. The target is 25.6, not 26.x or a Beta build; available older versions depend on Adobe distribution policies.
Before a large project, confirm the Windows 25.x system requirements: a supported 64-bit Windows release, AVX2-capable CPU, enough RAM, disk space and GPU support. In 25.6, OpenCL 2.0 is required where OpenCL is used; older 1.2 support is discontinued.
Start AE and identify Project, Composition viewer, Timeline, Effect Controls, Effects & Presets, Properties, Preview and Render Queue panels. Hover any panel and tap the backtick key (`) to maximize/restore it.
Choose Window → Workspace, select a standard layout and use Reset to Saved Layout if panels are lost. Use Edit → Preferences to configure auto-save, disk cache and available memory without starving Windows.
Create a dedicated folder such as D:\\AE_Learning\\01_First_Project. Reserve an Assets subfolder, an Output subfolder and a project backup folder. Avoid relying on temporary Downloads files.
Open Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts (Ctrl+Alt+') to verify bindings on your installed version and keyboard layout. Save a custom preset only if you intentionally change a shortcut.
''', 'I can verify 25.6 and locate every central panel.|I have an organized Windows project folder.|I know where the shortcut editor is.',

'interface version-workflow performance project-management', 'release history requirements shortcuts memory',diagram='screen')

lesson('logic','02 · Understand projects, comps, layers and pixels','START',
'Build a correct mental model before memorizing commands.', '''
A .aep project is a container of references, compositions, settings and animation; imported images and video normally remain external files. Save Project is not the same as Collect Files or render.
Create a 1920×1080, 24 fps, 8-second composition with Ctrl+N. Name it 01_LAB. Distinguish composition size, frame rate, duration, pixel aspect ratio and background color; the comp background is not automatically an opaque render layer.
Create a blue solid (Ctrl+Y), a text layer (Ctrl+T in an appropriate context), and an empty shape layer (Layer → New → Shape Layer). Stack order determines which pixels cover which in ordinary 2D.
Select the blue layer: P=Position, S=Scale, R=Rotation, T=Opacity, A=Anchor Point. Use Shift+P to add Position while other properties are displayed, and U for animated properties.
Toggle a layer eye, shy, solo, lock, effects (fx), motion blur and 3D switch. Explain how hiding an entire layer differs from bypassing just its effects. F4 changes switches/modes columns.
Learn the vocabulary: footage item vs footage layer, source vs instance, composition vs precomposition, property vs keyframe, mask vs shape, alpha channel vs opacity, effect vs shape operator.
''', 'I can describe the project/comp/layer hierarchy.|I can distinguish source items from instances.|I can reveal five transform properties.',
'Duplicate the blue solid layer twice; assign each instance a different Opacity. Observe that all three layers refer to the same Solid Footage source in the Project panel.',
'Pressing a stopwatch that is already active removes its keyframes.|A background color setting does not add opaque pixels to your output.',
'interface layer-anatomy coordinates render-order',diagram='layers')

lesson('assets','03 · Import and inspect footage correctly','START',
'Learn what AE assumes when interpreting each media asset.', '''
Use Ctrl+I to import a PNG with alpha, a JPG, a short constant-frame-rate video, a WAV file and—when available—an image sequence. Check whether the source is a file, sequence or folder.
Double-click footage in Project to open its Footage panel. Compare footage time and frame dimensions with those of your composition. Drag footage into a comp; inspect scaling and frame-rate behavior.
Right-click footage → Interpret Footage → Main. Identify frame rate assumption, field order, pixel aspect ratio and alpha interpretation (straight vs premultiplied); note color options separately.
For an image sequence, select the first frame and use the sequence checkbox only when intended. Verify that frames were numbered without gaps and their order is correct.
Replace a selected layer’s source by Alt-dragging a different source from Project onto the layer. Confirm transform animation and effects remain in place. Distinguish replacing a layer source from replacing a Project item globally.
Make an Assets folder in Project, sort sources and keep originals on disk. If Windows drive letters or source folders change, use Replace Footage to relink the existing Project item; importing the same file again creates a separate item and may leave broken layer references unresolved.
''', 'I can interpret footage and verify source frame rates.|I can replace footage without losing a layer animation.|I know where a missing-file reference points.',

'Variable-frame-rate recordings can cause erratic time or audio sync; use a constant-frame-rate transcode when needed.|Premultiplied alpha interpreted as straight can cause a dark fringe.',
'import-media alpha footage-interpretation file-management',diagram='layers')

lesson('timing','04 · Read time, frames, trims and the work area','START',
'The difference between layer time, source time and comp time prevents silent editing errors.', '''
In the Timeline, place the current-time indicator (CTI) at exactly 00:00:02:00 at 24 fps. Use Page Up/Page Down to step frames; Shift+Page Up/Down steps ten frames. Read timecode as hours:minutes:seconds:frames.
Use B and N to set an intentionally short work area. Start/stop Preview with Space; observe the Preview panel options. The work area is a range for preview/render control, not a change to source duration.
With CTI at 1 second, select a footage layer and press [ to shift its entire layer bar so the In point meets CTI. Next move CTI to 2 seconds, press Alt+[ to trim the In point without moving the entire layer. Undo twice and compare layer Start Time, In point and source frames.
Use Alt+] to trim the out point, Ctrl+Shift+D to split, Ctrl+D to duplicate, and I/O to jump to a selected layer’s in/out points. Practice knowing which commands change the source span.
Move the Timeline zoom using = / - on the main keyboard. Toggle full-span/single-frame viewing with ;. View one exact source frame, then locate it after shifting the layer.
Set marker(s) to plan beats. A composition marker differs from a layer marker; both differ from a keyframe. Save an experiment copy before drastic trimming.
''', 'I can step to a specific frame.|I know the distinction between moving, trimming and splitting.|I can define a work area.',

'frames timeline source-time',diagram='timeline')

lesson('transform','05 · Anchor, Position, Scale and parenting','START',
'Spatial transforms are predictable once you understand coordinate spaces.', '''
Draw a 200×200 rectangle in a Shape Layer. Press P to inspect the comp-space Position of the shape layer’s anchor; press A to inspect its layer-space Anchor Point (which may not coincide with the rectangle’s own group center). Changing one is not the same as changing the other.
Move the anchor with the Pan Behind tool (Y). Rotate with R; notice where rotation occurs. To center the anchor within content, test Ctrl+Alt+Home and compare the result with Ctrl+Home, which centers the layer’s anchor in the comp.
Create a Null Object (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Y). Parent the shape and text to the null using the Parent & Link pick whip. Move, scale and rotate the null; then inspect each child’s local transform.
Unparent one child and watch its on-screen pose if AE compensates its transform. Explain why parenting does not mean copying Position keyframes or merging layers.
For a 3D layer, Position has three dimensions and rotation/orientation differs from the 2D case. Do not introduce a camera yet; use the 3D switch only for a controlled experiment.
Build a single controller named CTRL_RIG, and do not put unrelated effects on it. Label layers clearly and lock controllers when their position is correct.
''', 'I can tell anchor and position apart.|I can parent two layers to a null.|I can explain local vs comp coordinates.',
'Animate the null in a circle while rotating an independently animated child around its own pivot.',
'Changing a child parent can alter coordinate interpretation.|Centering a layer and centering its anchor are different commands.',
'coordinates parenting 3d-intro',diagram='coordinates')

lesson('keys','06 · Create and remove keyframes safely','FOUNDATIONS',
'Animate one number correctly before adding complex rigs.', '''
Add a Position keyframe at time 0 by clicking the stopwatch once. Move to 1 second and drag the object to a new Position. Inspect the two diamonds in the Timeline.
Return to time 0, reveal Opacity with T, set it to 100 and click its stopwatch to create the first Opacity keyframe. Then move to 2 seconds and change Opacity to 0 to create the second key. Without that first keyframe, the change at 2 seconds would simply set a constant value rather than a fade.
Select only one keyframe and press Delete. Rebuild it. To remove all Position keys, click the active stopwatch: observe that every keyframe vanishes and the current value is retained. Undo immediately.
Use U to show only animated properties, UU to show all properties modified from defaults, and K/J to jump visible keyframes/markers.
Use Alt+Shift+P or Alt+Shift+T to add/remove a key at CTI on the appropriate property; this does not toggle the whole property’s animation stopwatch.
Copy two selected Position keyframes, place CTI elsewhere and paste. Note that the first pasted key usually aligns with CTI. Use a separate duplicate layer to compare variations.
''', 'I can create, move and remove a single keyframe.|I understand the dangerous stopwatch toggle.|I can show only animated properties.',
'Animate a circle from x=200 to x=1720 in exactly 2 seconds, then fade it in for the first 12 frames.',
'Auto-keyframing can enable animation for new properties automatically; leave it off while learning.|Deleting one key is not the same as deactivating the stopwatch.',
'keyframes timeline',diagram='timeline')

lesson('easing','07 · Design motion with the Graph Editor','FOUNDATIONS',
'Good animation depends on velocity and spacing, not just destinations.', '''
Create Position keyframes 0 and 1 second, 800 pixels apart. Set both Linear, preview, and notice constant perceived speed on a straight path.
Select both keys and press F9 (Easy Ease). Use Shift+F3 to open the Graph Editor. Locate Speed Graph and Value Graph modes; for Position, choosing Separate Dimensions changes the way you can edit curves.
In Speed Graph, make the object accelerate quickly and decelerate gently. Preview and compare. Inspect motion-path dots: dense dots represent smaller distance per sample and hence slower motion.
Make a third middle Position key; separate spatial path curvature (trajectory) from the time interpolation (velocity). A curved path can move at constant speed, and a straight path can ease.
Use Easy Ease In/Out intentionally. For a stepped stop-motion look, test Toggle Hold Keyframe. Observe that Hold is not the same as a slow Bézier curve.
Open Keyframe Velocity (Ctrl+Shift+K) when numerical influence is necessary. Save a tiny file containing three clearly named easing examples.
''', 'I can explain speed vs value graphs.|I can make linear, eased and hold movement.|I understand spatial vs temporal curves.',
'Make three identical circles travel 500 px with linear, ease-out and overshoot movement; render a side-by-side comparison.',
'Tweaking spatial Bézier handles changes the path rather than temporal easing.|Position Separate Dimensions removes the unified motion path representation.',
'graph-editor keyframes motion-design',diagram='graph')

lesson('paths','08 · Draw shapes and parametric shape operators','FOUNDATIONS',
'Distinguish vector geometry, paths, styles and per-group transformations.', '''
Deselect all layers and use Q to draw a rectangle. It creates a Shape Layer. Expand Contents → Rectangle → Rectangle Path, Fill, Stroke, and the shape group’s Transform; compare with the layer’s separate Transform group.
Make an Ellipse and a Polystar with the Q tool cycle. Change parametric Size, Roundness, Points and radii. Do not convert to Bézier until you actually need manual vertices.
Use Contents → Add → Trim Paths and animate End from 0 to 100 on a stroked path. Set Start and Offset to explore moving a dash around a loop.
Use Repeater to create repeated copies of a group. Find Copies, Offset and Transform: Repeater → Position, Rotation, Scale. Explain why changing original geometry affects every repeated instance.
Explore Offset Paths, Pucker & Bloat, Zig Zag, Twist and Wiggle Paths one at a time. Turn each operator off and on to isolate its effect.
Convert a duplicated parametric path to Bézier; move a vertex with Pen/Selection tools. Try a closed filled shape and an open stroked path to compare filling behavior.
''', 'I can locate group Transform vs layer Transform.|I can animate Trim Paths and Repeater.|I can choose parametric vs Bézier geometry.',
'Make a rotating loading indicator consisting of twelve repeated ticks and a Trim Paths ring.',
'An empty Shape Layer has no visible pixels.|Shape operators are not in the Effect Controls effects list.',
'shapes paths strokes',diagram='layers')

lesson('masks','09 · Understand masks and alpha','FOUNDATIONS',
'Transparency has several independent sources, each suited to different work.', '''
Add a photograph to a comp. Select the photograph and draw a rectangle: it normally creates a mask on the selected layer. Deselect and draw another rectangle: it creates a shape layer. Check the toolbar mask/shape mode.
Press MM to reveal mask groups. For each mask test Mode Add, Subtract, Intersect and None, then change Feather, Expansion and Opacity and invert the mask.
Animate Mask Path over several frames to follow a moving subject. Make simple wide shapes first; excessive vertices are harder to stabilize and maintain.
Set a high feather value, then change layer Opacity separately. Inspect the Alpha channel via Alt+4. A transparent pixel can still have RGB values; alpha determines coverage.
Draw two masks on the same layer; test which mode is used and whether the order changes results. Enable/disable masks independently without deleting their path keys.
Precompose masked imagery and compare the look with and without Collapse Transformations in a controlled vector/precomp case; do not assume the switch is a free quality upgrade.
''', 'I can create a mask on a selected layer.|I can adjust feather, expansion and modes.|I can inspect actual alpha separately.',
'Cut a circular window into a photo and animate the window to follow a bouncing ball.',
'An animated mask is not a motion-tracked mask until you track it.|High feather is not a cure for poor matte edges.',
'masks alpha mattes',diagram='alpha')

lesson('mattes','10 · Use track mattes and blend modes','FOUNDATIONS',
'Mattes let one layer control visibility of another without drawing directly on the target.', '''
Create a text layer above a video layer. In the video layer’s TrkMat column select the text layer as its matte source. Modern AE track mattes can refer to another layer without that matte being directly above the target.
Test Alpha Matte versus Alpha Inverted Matte. Then use a luminance gradient and select Luma Matte versus Luma Inverted Matte. Identify what white, black and grey mean in each mode.
Try a transparent red-to-blue shape as a matte and inspect why its alpha can be constant although its luminance varies dramatically. Convert to grayscale for a predictable luma test.
Use F4 to reveal Switches/Modes where necessary. Compare Normal, Multiply, Screen, Add and Overlay on the same footage with two test layers.
Precompose only when the matte has to become a reusable source or when an effect must operate after the matte. A simple matte relationship does not automatically require a precomp.
Render to a format supporting alpha and verify transparency over a checkerboard outside AE. A matte preview on black is not proof that alpha was exported.
''', 'I can choose alpha vs luma matte.|I can invert either matte.|I can demonstrate an actual transparent export.',
'Make a 3-second title reveal in which video is visible only inside moving letters.',
'Screen blend mode against black does not create real alpha.|Layer opacity and track-matte coverage multiply in the final composite.',

lesson('precomp','11 · Precompositions, nested time and render order','FOUNDATIONS',
'Precomps organize work, but also change which operations happen first.', '''
Select three animated layers and precompose with Ctrl+Shift+C. Name the new comp 02_ICON_UNIT; with multiple selected layers After Effects uses Move all attributes into the new composition. To compare with Leave all attributes, make a separate single-layer footage/solid test (not a shape or text layer), precompose it, and inspect both dialog choices.
Open the precomp and note the inner time, duration, and layer layout. Return to the master comp and alter the precomp layer transform. Inspect whether the inner animation still plays as intended.
Apply Gaussian Blur to a shape, then precompose with different attribute settings; compare effect-before-transform with effect-after-transform. Render order is the reason precomposing can change an effect’s appearance.
In a duplicated test comp, toggle Collapse Transformations on the nested comp. Observe changed transformations, masks, 3D interactions and effect results rather than universally enabling the switch.
Use Time Remapping and an Essential Property only after the nested comp behaves consistently. Name instances uniquely when they need different controls.
Add a short marker on master comp corresponding to a specific event inside the precomp. Document any shifted inner start times and audio synchronization.
''', 'I can precompose with an intentional attribute choice.|I can explain a changed blur after precomposition.|I can locate inner vs outer time.',

'precomp render-order essential-properties','help precompose',diagram='layers')

lesson('text','12 · Typography and animated text selectors','FOUNDATIONS',
'Type in motion is a system of characters, paragraphs, layout and animation selectors.', '''
Use Ctrl+T to create point text with a click and paragraph text by dragging a text box. Test different wrapping, alignment, font weight and paragraph settings in Character/Paragraph.
Make two headings with consistent font family and sizes; use tracking and leading intentionally. Use native text rather than rasterizing type when you need accessibility and later wording changes.
Expand Text → Animate → Position and add an Opacity animator. Open Range Selector → Advanced; compare Based On Characters, Characters Excluding Spaces, Words and Lines.
Animate Range Selector Offset from -100% to 100% to sweep a reveal. Compare Smoothness 0 to 100 and different selector shapes for stepped vs continuous entrances.
Use Text → Path Options when appropriate to put characters along a mask path. A text-on-path system is different from converting text to outlines.
Create two text layers, apply only a few font and style changes, and test 25.4+ copy/paste text formatting where available. Verify the paste action in the text editing context.
''', 'I can distinguish point and paragraph text.|I can animate words and letters separately.|I can use Range Selector Offset.',

lesson('effects','13 · Learn effects, order and adjustment layers','FOUNDATIONS',
'Effects compute images in sequence, and the order is part of the design.', '''
Create a solid with Fractal Noise; apply Levels, Tint, Turbulent Displace and Glow in that order. Duplicate the layer and reorder Glow before Levels. Compare the different result.
Open Effect Controls with F3. Rename each effect instance by its purpose. Toggle its fx switch; note that disabling an effect is nondestructive while Ctrl+Shift+E removes all effects from selected layers.
Make an Adjustment Layer (Ctrl+Alt+Y) and apply Curves. Put it above two footage layers; toggle layer order and note which lower pixels it modifies.
Compare an effect applied to a footage layer, the same effect on a precomp, and an effect on an adjustment layer. They do not use identical inputs in all cases.
Open the Effect Manager if a plugin appears missing or disabled. Use Effects & Presets search rather than assuming every installed effect has an application-wide search launcher; Quick Apply (Ctrl+Enter) is 26.2, not 25.6.
Test effect compatibility at 8, 16 and 32 bpc in Project Settings. An effect may process fewer bit depths or be CPU-only; check supported modes for the actual installed 25.6 effect.
''', 'I can rearrange effects to change render results.|I understand adjustment layers.|I can distinguish bypass from deletion.',

lesson('blur','14 · Blur, glow, noise and depth maps','INTERMEDIATE',
'Understand the purpose of blur and procedural textures instead of applying random presets.', '''
Place Gaussian Blur on a photographic layer. Increase Blurriness and compare Repeat Edge Pixels on/off around the boundaries.
On a duplicate, use Camera Lens Blur and configure lens properties. Compare computational cost and appearance with a Gaussian Blur of similar apparent radius.
Generate a grayscale Fractal Noise texture on another layer. Use Displacement Map to warp a checkerboard; inspect map source channel, Max Horizontal/Vertical Displacement and map resolution.
Try Compound Blur or Camera Lens Blur with a blur/depth map and feathered transitions. A depth map controls *where* blurring occurs; it is not the same as overall lens bokeh settings.
Make a glow source by isolating bright pixels through Levels, then apply Glow with intentional Threshold, Radius and Intensity. Note why adding glow to a full-bright white rectangle washes out the whole scene.
Animate Fractal Noise Evolution and Offset Turbulence. Use it as a texture, matte, displacement driver or blend overlay, checking noise aliasing at final resolution.

lesson('timefx','15 · Time remap, speed, loops and motion blur','INTERMEDIATE',
'Temporal sampling affects motion even when no transform changes.', '''
Put a clip in a comp. Compare Time Stretch, Time-Reverse Layer (Ctrl+Alt+R), and Time Remapping (Ctrl+Alt+T). Record which changes source speed and which changes the timing of layer keyframes.
Enable Time Remapping on a duplicate and add a middle keyframe to speed up one segment and slow down another. Inspect interpolation: smooth time remapping can freeze or reverse segments.
For looping source playback, locate the final valid source frame and the default end-time key. Remove or adjust the problematic end key before adding loopOut('cycle') to Time Remap if required.
Use Posterize Time on a duplicate to create a stepped frame-rate aesthetic. Distinguish it from changing the *composition* frame rate.
Animate a fast-moving shape. Toggle its Motion Blur switch and the comp’s master Motion Blur switch. Adjust shutter angle and shutter phase under comp Advanced settings; judge at full speed.
Compare native motion blur with CC Force Motion Blur or Pixel Motion Blur where available. Third-party/plugins and frame interpolation may need substantially more rendering time.

lesson('audio','16 · Audio levels, waveform and reactive graphics','INTERMEDIATE',
'AE can synchronize and drive animation from audio, but is not a full DAW.', '''
Import a WAV with predictable beats. Press L for Audio Levels and LL (two quick taps) for its waveform; use numpad decimal for audio-only preview on a standard keyboard.
Set clear timeline markers at beats. Trim and reposition sound without accidentally offsetting its start relative to animated elements; use the Info panel if needed.
Select audio → Animation → Keyframe Assistant → Convert Audio to Keyframes. Inspect the resulting Audio Amplitude null and Both Channels Slider keyframes.
On a shape’s Scale, Alt+click the stopwatch and use a simple expression driven by the slider. For example: a=thisComp.layer('Audio Amplitude').effect('Both Channels')('Slider'); [100+a*2,100+a*2];.
Smooth noisy values with the smooth() expression when needed or keyframe smoothing, and clamp extreme peaks. Build a minimum scale so silence does not collapse the graphic.
Export a preview and listen to it. Audio playback from the computer can differ from a final encoded render; check that audio output is explicitly enabled in the Output Module.

lesson('keying','17 · Green/blue-screen compositing','INTERMEDIATE',
'Professional keying separates core opacity, edge detail and spill removal.', '''
Import evenly lit green-screen footage. Put a contrasting background beneath it, then apply Keylight (1.2) to the footage.
Pick a representative green Screen Colour away from hair/skin. Switch Keylight View to Screen Matte. Adjust Clip Black and Clip White moderately to establish opaque subject and clean background.
Inspect fine hair and semi-transparent material. Use Screen Shrink/Grow and Screen Softness carefully; extreme crushing loses legitimate edge detail.
Add Key Cleaner and Advanced Spill Suppressor after Keylight when useful. Compare suppression modes and check green reflections in grey or skin regions.
Use a garbage mask to eliminate off-screen gear and nonuniform regions before or alongside keying. Use separate inside and edge mattes for challenging footage rather than forcing one setting for every region.
Check the keyed subject against black, white, saturated grey and final intended background. Add light wrap/grade if visually needed, but keep a clean premultiplied edge.

lesson('tracking','18 · Track a moving point and stabilize motion','INTERMEDIATE',
'Tracking turns observations in footage into reusable transformations.', '''
Select a footage layer and open Window → Tracker. Choose Track Motion. Start with a high-contrast feature that does not rotate out of view; define Feature and Search Regions.
Track forward in small portions and inspect drift. Set the Attach Point thoughtfully; the feature region may move while the attachment stays separately positioned.
Create a Null, set Edit Target to that Null, and Apply the tracking data. Parent a graphic to the null rather than pasting tracking keys into every child.
Enable rotation and scale tracking by using two tracking points when the footage supports stable features. Know that point trackers cannot inherently solve full perspective deformation.
Use Stabilize Motion on a duplicate; note how the image edges move and why you may need scaling/cropping or synthesis for blank edges.
For planar surfaces and perspective replacement, open bundled Mocha AE, track a plane, then send corner-pin data back into AE. Verify the exact Mocha integration commands in the installed plugin version.

lesson('roto','19 · Roto Brush, Refine Edge and mask tracking','INTERMEDIATE',
'Extract moving subjects without the 2026 Object Matte feature.', '''
Duplicate a video layer and open that layer in the Layer panel, not only the Composition panel. Activate Roto Brush (Alt+W) and create foreground strokes where the intended subject has recognizable edges.
Use Alt with the brush, where supported, to subtract incorrectly selected regions. Identify the base frame and propagate forward/backward through a manageable span.
Scrub the full span and repair frames that drift, especially fast-moving hands, occlusions and hair. Use Refine Edge on semitransparent detail only after the main segmentation is stable.
Adjust Reduce Chatter, Feather, Shift Edge and Decontaminate Edge Colors as warranted, then Freeze propagation for the span. Keep the source footage available; Freeze is not the same as rendering a permanent matte file.
Use Mask Tracking on an appropriately drawn mask for rigid, easy-to-follow objects. If motion is complex, consider manual correction or a separate point/planar track.
Pre-render a clean RGBA intermediate when editing further becomes slow; verify that the output format actually retains an alpha channel.

lesson('paint','20 · Paint, clone and Content-Aware Fill','INTERMEDIATE',
'Moving from an obvious brush stroke to credible invisible repair requires temporal checking.', '''
Double-click footage to work in the Layer panel. Use Brush, Clone Stamp and Eraser there; the same tool is not just a normal Comp-view shape brush.
Set a Clone Stamp sampling point with Alt+click. Paint a small patch on a duplicate and test source alignment and stroke duration modes in the Paint panel.
Make a simple repair with painting, then preview over time. A correction that matches one frame can slide or flicker after motion unless properly tracked or the paint is adjusted.
Use a mask around an unwanted object, follow it with keyframes or tracking, and open Window → Content-Aware Fill. Select the appropriate Fill Method and Range, then Generate Fill Layer.
For a difficult frame, create a reference frame in Photoshop (when available) or a suitable still-image editor; fill the defect and return the reference to AE. Manage source paths and regenerated fills.
Evaluate repeated textures, camera motion, shadows and occlusion. Sometimes a clean plate plus planar tracking is more reliable than automated Fill.

'AE 3D layers exist in 3D space, but not every 3D-looking effect behaves as scene geometry.', '''
Turn on 3D switches for several photos or shape layers and separate them in Z depth. Create a Camera (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C). Distinguish 1-node and 2-node camera behavior, point of interest, zoom and field of view.
Create a Camera orbit Null and parent the camera to it for controlled moves, or animate camera Position/Point Of Interest intentionally. Use multiple views to check that foreground and background have the desired depth separation.
Add a Light (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L) and test Material Options on 3D layers. Understand Accepts Lights/Shadows and limitations of the selected 3D renderer.
Switch Project Settings/Composition Advanced 3D renderer only intentionally; Classic 3D, Cinema 4D and Advanced 3D do not have identical feature sets. Test native 3D models where supported.
In After Effects 25.6, select multiple 3D layers to use the shared/single 3D transform gizmo; also inspect View → Default Camera Settings for the new default camera controls.
For camera depth-of-field needs, verify the chosen renderer. 26.3 added in-engine Advanced 3D Depth of Field; do not confuse that newer feature with older camera DOF workflows in other renderers or 2D lens-blur simulations.

lesson('3dtrack','22 · Camera tracking and screen replacement','INTERMEDIATE',
'Choose a scene-solving tool based on camera motion rather than the look of the final effect.', '''
Use a shot with real parallax: camera moves through a room rather than only rotating from one point. Apply 3D Camera Tracker and allow Analysis/Solving to finish.
Inspect the track points and locate a plausible horizontal plane. Target a triad and create a Solid/Camera or Text/Camera. Check the solved graphic over all frames, not only the initial one.
If the solve is unstable, inspect fast pans, rolling shutter, motion blur, zoom changes, focal length and low-parallax shots. Trim and stabilize the analysis source where justified.
For a planar phone screen, compare Mocha AE corner pin or built-in perspective tracker. Use a high-contrast planar patch, not an assumption that a 3D camera solve will always be superior.
Track a sign or poster, then apply Corner Pin/CC Power Pin to the replacement screen. Control the insert’s color, noise and motion blur to match the plate.
Export a diagnostic video showing the tracker points or a checkerboard overlaid on the final surface; a drifting corner is easier to catch with a grid than with a textured replacement.

lesson('color','23 · Color correction, working space and alpha','INTERMEDIATE',
'Correct color requires keeping separate input interpretation, working-space math, display, and output.', '''
In File → Project Settings → Color, compare color-managed versus unmanaged workflows in a small 8/16/32-bpc experiment. Choose an intentional Working Color Space for the target delivery.
Inspect an imported image’s Interpret Footage color settings. When necessary, assign the right input profile; assigning a profile changes interpretation and is not the same thing as changing RGB values with an effect.
Use Lumetri Color, Curves and Levels on a test image. Correct exposure/contrast/white balance first, then make a look. View histograms or scopes where available and compare to a controlled reference.
Understand straight vs premultiplied alpha and RGB in transparent pixels. Remove Color Matting when necessary; a matte halo is not always fixed by globally sharpening an image.
For an OCIO/ACES workflow, select a known supported configuration, interpret input color spaces, preview through a chosen view transform, and set intended output transform. Do not claim native bundled ACES 2.0 configs in 25.6; those arrive in 26.5.
Export a tagged test image/video and compare the rendered file in a color-managed viewer. Different Windows video apps may apply different display transforms; check metadata, not just eye judgment.

lesson('expressions','24 · Expressions: build a repeatable controller','INTERMEDIATE',
'Expressions compute property values; learn safe interfaces before writing complex JavaScript.', '''
Create a Null named CTRL. Apply Effect → Expression Controls → Slider Control, rename it Speed. On another layer’s Rotation, Alt+click its stopwatch once and enter time*thisComp.layer('CTRL').effect('Speed')('Slider');.
Set Speed to 0, 90 and -45; verify that the graphic stops, rotates clockwise and counterclockwise. Your expression needs a numeric output because Rotation expects a scalar.
On a 2D Position property, enter wiggle(1,20); and compare with value+[Math.sin(time*2)*20,0];. Distinguish nondeterministic-looking wiggle from smooth periodic motion.
Make a 2D Scale expression using [100,100] or [s,s], not a lone scalar. Learn value, time, thisComp, thisLayer, framesToTime(), ease(), linear(), clamp(), loopOut().
Create two expression-linked layers using the pick whip rather than manually typing names, then rename a controller and inspect references. Handle missing effects or source layer changes carefully.
Toggle an expression off without deleting it. Use Animation → Keyframe Assistant → Convert Expression to Keyframes to bake a copy when needed for portability or delivery.

lesson('data','25 · Data-driven text and graphics','ADVANCED',
'Separate content from animation so recurring work is faster to update.', '''
Create a small UTF-8 CSV or TSV with name, score and color columns. Import it as data through File → Import and inspect its accessible data properties.
Use expression pick whipping or the available footage data methods to read row values. Start with literal values before adding a drop-down selector or a row index slider.
Create a Score text layer and set Source Text from a suitable string expression. Format numbers deliberately with Math.round(), toFixed() or String() where appropriate.
Build a background rectangle sized to text with sourceRectAtTime(); add horizontal and vertical padding, and inspect left/top offsets to avoid misalignment.
Try importing a small JSON object as footage and reading a nested key by expression using footage('filename.json').sourceData. Keep field names stable and check for missing keys.
Make a reusable template with editable content and named controls. Document what changes without touching timeline keys.

'Build assets that another editor can adjust without breaking a controlled design.', '''
Create a child comp containing a title, subtitle, color plate and simple entrance animation. Open Window → Essential Graphics and select the correct master composition.
Expose editable Source Text, key color controls and a Slider into Essential Graphics. Rename controls clearly, group when appropriate and provide default values.
Nest the child comp twice; inspect Essential Properties for each instance. Change one instance’s title and color while retaining the original child comp and other instance.
Test protected regions for intro/outro timing when building a reusable MOGRT, then stretch a middle region in a deliberately long test comp. Check that animation does not overlap unexpectedly.
Export a Motion Graphics Template (.mogrt) and choose the correct destination; use a video preview where supported. Verify third-party fonts/plugins or expression dependencies.
Open or install the MOGRT in a compatible Adobe workflow where available; test exposed controls, resolution and duration. Retain the original .aep and assets as source of truth.

'Use only the mesh and model capabilities actually available in AE 25.6.', '''
Import a supported 3D model format available to 25.6, including supported GLB/GLTF/OBJ or FBX as applicable to your project/build. Inspect scale, axes, texture material paths and animation playback.
Create a 3D composition using the Advanced 3D renderer. Add an environment light or HDRI for reflections and test an animated environment light (introduced in 25.2).
Check each model’s Material Options, Accepts Lights, Shadows and shadow-catcher workflow. Compare quality/performance options and confirm the actual render, not only Fast Draft.
Use the shared single 3D gizmo on multiple selected 3D layers (25.6 feature) to transform as a group visually. Learn that it changes individual layers; it is not necessarily a persistent parent rig.
Change View → Default Camera Settings (25.6) to adjust the way default/custom views behave. Save a test and inspect composition views before and after.
For geometric primitives, create shapes or use an imported mesh asset. Direct native parametric 3D mesh creation and Substance 3D material support belong to 26.0+, not this manual’s target.

'Animate flexible artwork without cutting it into dozens of rigid pieces.', '''
Import a transparent character or ribbon. Duplicate the source and apply Puppet pins to a clean alpha layer while in the relevant Puppet tool mode.
Add pins to stable regions first: base/shoulder, elbow and tip. Move a single pin over time and inspect how the mesh deforms between pins.
Explore Overlap and Starch tools to control drawing order and rigidity in supported Puppet modes. Place pins where the mesh should bend and where it should resist stretching.
Reduce pin counts until you can understand every pin. An over-constrained mesh creates awkward hard bends or almost no visible motion.
Precompose when the Puppet effect needs to move with a separate rigid transform. Compare deform-then-scale with scale-then-deform in your hierarchy.
Render a seamless 2-second loop; inspect pin intersections and anti-aliased alpha edges at every extreme.

lesson('particles','29 · Native particle and simulation systems','ADVANCED',
'Learn particle emitters, lifetimes and physics controls through measurable experiments.', '''
Apply CC Particle World to a solid. Find Producer Position and Radius, Birth Rate, Longevity, Particle Type, Velocity, Gravity and Resistance controls.
Set Birth Rate low and Longevity short. Measure how many visible particles appear at once; rough steady count depends on rate × lifetime, though frame integration and fade settings affect the rendered result.
Make a second particle system using CC Particle Systems II. Compare available controls and rendering performance instead of assuming both systems are interchangeable.
Try CC Rainfall or CC Snowfall and then Foam or CC Bubbles. Understand emitter-based versus image-distortion-based animation.
Precompose particle sources when layering glow, blur and mattes. Test whether effect order changes source/particle size or the glow of particles.
Make a 5-second rain field that respects foreground occlusion via track matte and includes variation in size, velocity and blur.

lesson('render','30 · Render Queue, codecs, alpha and audio','DELIVERY',
'Choose the output to match its downstream use and verify what the render actually contains.', '''
Save your project. Select the final composition and use Ctrl+Shift+/ to add it to Render Queue. Inspect Render Settings, Output Module, and Output To separately.
Set a working review output, such as an H.264 MP4 where the installed 25.6 encoder and selected output route support it. Alternatively queue an Adobe Media Encoder output using Ctrl+Alt+M. Do not rely on one codec for every delivery.
For a master or intermediate, choose a high-quality suitable codec such as ProRes or DNxHR (where available), or an image sequence. Specify bit depth, frame rate, color tagging and audio as intended.
For transparency, use a format/codecs that support alpha, select RGB+Alpha, and specify Straight or Premultiplied according to downstream requirements. Standard H.264 MP4 generally does not carry normal AE RGBA transparency.
Render only intended work area or entire comp explicitly. Check that the final frame, 100% resolution, high-quality sampling and motion blur correspond to your delivery requirements.
Open the rendered output in a separate player/editor. Count frames, inspect audio sync, color, alpha and first/last frame. A successful Render Queue status does not certify the file is correct.

Save the working .aep, then use File → Dependencies → Collect Files to gather used sources into a package. Read the available options and select a dedicated collection folder.
Relocate/copy the collected folder to a different Windows path or drive letter, open the collected .aep and verify it uses collected assets rather than the old disk locations.
Audit installed fonts, effects, scripts, external 3D textures, render destinations, proxies and dynamically linked dependencies. Collect Files is not a guarantee of third-party plugin portability.
Generate an explicit README listing AE version 25.6, frame rates, render settings, color management, input dependencies, licensed assets and any known limitations.
Use versioned project saves such as Project_v001.aep and Increment and Save; maintain automated backups where configured. Restore a backup before trusting the process.
Consider making a high-quality pre-render or flattened proof video for reviewers who cannot open AE. Keep editable project and rendered approval media separate.

lesson('performance','32 · Performance, memory, cache and proxies','DELIVERY',
'Optimize the actual bottleneck instead of deleting caches reflexively.', '''
Save a slow experiment project. Time a cold preview and a repeated warm preview over the same work area before changing settings.
Set viewer resolution Half or Quarter for fast interaction when appropriate; note that changing view quality does not automatically guarantee a full-resolution final render.
Inspect Edit → Preferences → Memory & Performance and Disk Cache settings. Reserve adequate RAM for Windows, choose a fast drive with spare capacity, and understand that purging invalidates useful cached frames.
Compare one CPU-bound procedural effect, GPU-accelerated effect, and codec-decoding bottleneck. Watch whether performance changes when an effect switch is turned off.
Use proxy footage or pre-renders for expensive sources and comps when appropriate. Keep a clear replacement/restore path so that final output uses the intended sources.
Check Multi-Frame Rendering and limitations of plugins. For a pathological project, disable suspect third-party effects one at a time and test safe startup rather than assuming the GPU always causes slowdowns.

'Identify whether a problem is source, interpretation, transform, matte, effect, render or environment.', '''
When the Comp viewer is black, check active comp, time, layer In/Out, eye, solo, opacity, mask, matte, blend mode and viewer channel before touching effects.
If the result is different after precomposing, compare render order, collapse transformations, effect stacks, adjustment layer scope and color management.
If preview is frozen, disable Caps Lock, inspect Preview settings and work area, then confirm a frame has been rendered. Restart only after a simple reproducible check.
If an effect is missing, inspect Effect Manager, plugin installation, 8/16/32-bpc support and whether it was introduced after 25.6. Replace unsupported features rather than inventing a hidden menu.
If output differs from Comp viewer, compare Render Settings, Output Module, output color space, channel selection, renderer and file playback transform.

lesson('automation','34 · ExtendScript, scripts and batch workflow','ADVANCED',
'Understand which tasks need property expressions and which need application automation.', '''
Distinguish expressions (a formula on a property, evaluated over time) from ExtendScript/JSX scripts (commands that build or edit project objects). A regular expression cannot import and rename 200 files or create arbitrary layers.
Learn the project object model at a high level: app.project, items, compositions, layers, properties, keyframes, and render queue items. Keep automation scripts narrowly scoped.
Create a reversible experiment: a simple JSX script run through File → Scripts → Run Script File that makes a named solid and saves no files automatically. Review permissions/prefs relevant to scripts before running.
Use undo groups around edits and test on a copy. Always guard the selected item type and active composition before dereferencing it.
For external data, prefer explicit JSON/CSV inputs, deterministic naming and a record of generated assets. Do not put sensitive information inside easily shared project expressions.
Try a batch task such as renaming layers with a prefix or setting comp frame rates only after manually checking the intended targets. Compare before/after project structure.

At 2–6 seconds, animate a set of three cards with a Null controller and either a text animator or template-driven properties. Make their timing editable without rebuilding the graphic.
Add a short compositing moment: tracked corner-pin insert, a keyed subject or a clean roto. Do not fake one if source footage is unavailable; use a self-generated shape/matte demonstration and document the substitution.
At 6–9 seconds, finish a procedural transition using Fractal Noise, Displacement Map or Glow. Audio should enter and leave cleanly, and the last second should contain a readable final message.

Project and composition::The Project panel stores footage, comps and folders. Composition viewer shows a rendered view of one composition at a given time, with guides and on-canvas controls. Double-clicking footage opens the Footage panel; double-clicking a footage layer can open the Layer panel.
Timeline and Effects::Timeline hosts layers, track mattes, time spans, properties, expressions, keyframes and graph curves. Effect Controls displays the selected layer’s effect stack; Effects & Presets is a catalog/search area for available effects and animation presets.

Files are not embedded automatically::An .aep project points to sources and stores transformations and project data. Two layers can reference one source item, and two comps can nest the same precomp; changing the nested original impacts both copies unless overridden.
What lives on a layer::A layer has In/Out, transform, masks, effects, blending mode, mattes, switches, parenting, keyframes and other type-specific properties. Effects modify generated pixel data; they are not identical to a shape layer’s Contents operators.
Comp settings affect interpretation::Composition FPS defines its frame grid; resolution and pixel aspect determine the render canvas. The footage source has its own interpretation, while the comp layer instance has its own transform and time placement.

Naming schemes::Give comps distinctive prefixes (FINAL_, SCENE_, PRE_, CTRL_) and avoid duplicate or confusing names for controllers used in expressions. Label colors aid navigation but must not be the only source of meaning.

Footage vs layer::Importing creates a footage item in Project. Dragging it into a composition creates a layer instance with its own in point, transform and effects. Deleting an instance does not necessarily delete the source item.
Sequence and alpha::Numbered images can become one time-based sequence. Check whether alpha is straight or premultiplied; a premultiplied RGB fringe should not be interpreted as an image with independent straight edge colors.
Dynamic links and layered PSD/AI::Where supported, import a layered image as Composition — Retain Layer Sizes to keep logical layers. Inspect the anchor and coordinate placement after the import. Dynamic Link/Photoshop/Illustrator updates need the original source app/assets.

Frame rates::When footage is interpreted at a different FPS, it may run faster/slower. Time stretch and frame blending are different from reinterpretation. Variable-frame-rate recordings may need transcoding to constant frame rate.
Alpha types::Straight/unmatted pixels encode RGB independently of alpha. Premultiplied/matted pixels were already mixed against a matte color; interpreting them incorrectly often creates dark/light halos.
Pixel aspect and fields::A non-square pixel interpretation scales geometry, not just final output dimensions. Interlaced fields and separated-fields options matter for legacy broadcast material and can cause combing if interpreted wrong.

Layer sampling::Source footage at 30 fps inside a 24-fps comp is sampled at the comp frame grid, potentially repeating/dropping frames or using blending. Audio is time-based and should be inspected independently of visual frame matching.
Useful arithmetic::Duration seconds = frames / fps. 72 frames at 24 fps = 3 seconds; 100 frames at 25 fps = 4 seconds. Use the guide’s frame calculator to explore rates and offsets.

Three positions::The composition playhead indicates comp time; the layer’s bar shows In/Out times in that comp; footage source time indicates which source frame is used. A precomp also has its own inner timeline.
Move versus trim::[ and ] reposition entire selected layers to CTI using their In/Out references; Alt+[ and Alt+] trim at CTI. Ctrl+Shift+D splits. These are not equivalent to moving animation keyframes only.
Markers and work area::B/N set work area ends for local preview/render planning. Main keyboard digits may navigate numbered comp markers, while numpad keys can select layers or start a preview depending on focus.

Anchor versus position::Anchor is in the layer’s own coordinate system; Position specifies the anchor in parent/comp coordinates. Moving an anchor can appear to shift the image unless AE compensates its Position when using Pan Behind.
Transform nesting::A shape group has its own Transform inside Contents, plus the layer Transform. A child layer uses parent-space Position; a 3D layer can have X/Y/Z and Orientation as well as Rotation values.
Converting positions::Expressions provide toComp(), fromComp(), toWorld(), fromWorld() and related methods for correct cross-coordinate conversion. A direct Position link is only straightforward when both properties share the same coordinate context.

Parent-child relationships::A child inherits transforms from its parent but retains independent local animation. Parent to a Null for a clean control layer rather than applying identical Position keyframes to every object.
Controllers::Use descriptive names and Expression Controls for user-facing parameters. Parent a child only once in a hierarchy; avoid creating circular dependencies through expressions.
Rig safety::Duplicate a rig and check whether expressions reference the duplicated or original controls. Essential Properties are often more suitable for controlled per-instance variation than unstructured cross-comp expressions.

Recording properties::Enable the stopwatch when you mean to animate. At a new time, editing the value creates an additional key. Changing a static value before enabling a stopwatch does not record a time history.
Interpolation::Linear changes at uniform numeric rate, Hold jumps, Bézier allows easing. Rotation angle and 2D Position follow different units, so similar graphs can still produce different perceived motion.
Keyframe housekeeping::U reveals keyed properties, J/K navigate visible time events, and Ctrl+Shift+K opens velocity controls. Ctrl-click in a keyframe view is contextual; learn the specific mode before editing.

Speed vs value::A Value Graph plots the property value over time. A Speed Graph plots the rate of change. A flat speed graph can correspond to a sloped linear position value graph.
Influence and handles::Temporal Bézier handles control easing at keys. At a given duration, sharper influence usually shifts which portions of the journey happen quickly versus slowly. The path can remain straight.
Spatial keys::Position motion paths have separate spatial Bézier interpolation; a curved trajectory does not guarantee ease. Rove Across Time can redistribute intermediate spatial keys but not arbitrary hold or non-spatial properties.

Pose and hold::Allow time for reading after a title enters. Motion that never stops is often harder to follow; a clean hold creates hierarchy and reduces attention fatigue.
Overlap and anticipation::Offset related layer animation by a few frames using measured timing, not arbitrary random delays. For a 24-fps comp, 6 frames = 0.25 seconds; choose offsets based on readability.

Shape structure::Shape Layer → Contents contains groups. Each group may contain path, fill, stroke, group transform and operators; the layer has its own Transform independently.
Keep parameters live::Rectangle Path Size and Roundness allow reusable UI-like cards. Polystar Path lets you animate point count and radii. Converting to Bézier gives vertex freedom but sacrifices simple parametric controls.

Mask path::A mask path defines visible pixels and has Mode, Feather, Opacity and Expansion. Mask Path keyframes animate that outline, not the layer Position itself.
Shape path::A Shape Path defines fill/stroke geometry and can be a live parametric outline or a vertex-editable Bézier curve. It can be copied between compatible path properties in many situations.
Motion path::A Position property with spatial animation creates a trajectory whose dots represent temporal samples. Its vertices and handles change spatial travel, while keyframes/Graph Editor define timing.

topic('strokes','Shape strokes, Trim Paths and Write-on','Animation','Choose between drawing geometry and painting pixels.', '''
Stroke types::Shape Stroke is vector line styling inside a Shape Layer. The Stroke effect can reveal a mask path on footage or a solid. Write-on uses paint-like accumulation and has its own timing controls.
Dashed paths::A shape stroke can have dashes, caps, joins and taper depending on the shape controls. Trim Paths Start/End define the visible portion of a path, while Offset rotates this visible window.
Compositing::To make a tracked outline, first track/animate the path, then generate a stroke, then optionally add Glow. Use a solid or precomp so the stroke has enough output dimensions when necessary.

topic('masks','Mask modes and feathering','Compositing','Masks edit layer transparency while preserving source pixels.', '''
Mode logic::Add reveals, Subtract removes, Intersect retains shared area. Inverted changes interpretation. With multiple masks, compositing behavior depends on mode, ordering and the layer’s alpha.
Edge controls::Feather produces a soft transition, Expansion dilates/erodes region borders and Mask Opacity scales contribution. Variable/per-vertex feathering can handle nonuniform boundaries.
Animated masks::With a selected mask path stopwatch, edit vertices over time. Fewer stable vertices generally track better than dozens of imprecise ones.

topic('alpha','Alpha, straight RGB and premultiplication','Compositing','Transparency is separate from visible RGB even when pixels look black.', '''
Representation::An RGBA pixel stores red, green, blue and alpha. Alpha=0 need not force RGB=0 in all representations. In straight alpha, RGB is often intended unmultiplied; premultiplied RGB already contains transparency/color matte interaction.
Artifacts::Dark outlines on translucent edges commonly result from misinterpreted alpha or resampling a matte-color-contaminated source. Inspect straight RGB and alpha separately before adding choker/blur.
Delivery::A codec/container must carry an alpha plane, and the output module must export RGB+Alpha correctly. Many MP4 H.264 workflows do not carry ordinary RGBA transparency.

Alpha matte::Visible matte alpha determines the target’s coverage. A red opaque matte and blue opaque matte cover equally if both have full alpha.
Luma matte::Luminance of a matte determines visibility. Black gives none and white gives full coverage; mid-gray gives partial coverage. Color gradients can behave unlike alpha-only gradients.
Flexible setup::Modern track mattes let the target reference an appropriate other layer in the comp. One matte may be reused in more than one place; keep the source named and be aware of comp boundaries.

Ordinary compositing::Normal combines pixels by alpha. Multiply darkens based on RGB product; Screen generally lightens; Add sums channels and can clip or exceed normal ranges in high-bit-depth projects.
Order matters::A blend mode acts on a layer relative to what has been composited below it. Reordering layers often changes the look, even when no keyframes change.
Alpha does not follow automatically::Screening a black-background explosion may visually hide black but does not magically reconstruct fully useful alpha. Check the deliverable’s requirements.

Processing chain::A simplified layer flow considers source, masks and effects, transformations, layer styles and compositing. Actual order can vary with layer type, 3D renderer and continuously rasterized/precomp settings.
Precompose effects::Moving effects inside versus leaving them outside a precomp can shift which pixels are processed at what scale/geometry. Use two simple controls to prove the cause.
Adjustments and nested comps::An adjustment layer affects pixels composited beneath it inside its active group/context. Nesting can change what image it receives and where it is calculated.

Two contexts::Inner composition time, resolution, frame rate, layer transforms and effects can all differ from the outer master comp. Time Remapping on outer precomp changes sampled inner time.
Move attributes choice::When precomposing, whether attributes move into the new comp changes how/where an effect is evaluated. Test with one blur and one transform rather than memorizing the dialog without context.
Maintainable nesting::Keep comp hierarchies shallow enough to inspect. Prefix names, write purposeful notes and avoid accidentally creating expression dependencies across unstable names.

Processing order::Fractal Noise → Levels → Glow does not necessarily match Fractal Noise → Glow → Levels. The first can threshold which regions glow; the second can recolor/clamp the already glowing output.
Effect Controls::Use F3 to inspect, rename and reorder effect instances. The fx switch bypasses individual effects and the layer fx switch bypasses effects as a set; deleting all effects is destructive.
Scope::A blur on a source layer differs from a blur on a precomp or an adjustment layer. Effect operating bounds, alpha and precomp render order can change the visible result.

What they sample::Adjustment layers take the composite below within their scope and process it through effects. Use them to keep repeated color/grain/blur calculations under control.
Limiting scope::Trim adjustment In/Out, use masks or mattes, or nest intended layers into a precomp so only that result receives the change.
Adjustment vs solid::A solid with an effect is still an ordinary image source unless effect/composite settings cause it to act differently. An adjustment layer is a special processing layer.

Ordinary blur::Gaussian Blur is predictable and often economical. Directional Blur resembles linear streaking; Radial Blur simulates radial spin/zoom; Unsharp Mask enhances edges rather than smoothing.
Lens look::Camera Lens Blur can shape bokeh highlights and blur-map-dependent focus. It may be more expensive than a Gaussian blur; test representative shots and settings.

Value vs action::A property expression is computed as the composition renders. It changes a property value; it cannot arbitrarily add layers or save files.
Functions::Use time, value, wiggle(), ease(), linear(), clamp(), loopOut(), valueAtTime(), sourceRectAtTime(), toComp() and matching property types. On Position return a 2D/3D array as appropriate.
Selection and errors::Alt+click a stopwatch to create/remove an expression; the expression enable/disable switch is safer for temporary comparisons. Enable expression errors and resolve missing referenced effects or layers.

Types::Numbers, arrays and strings differ. A 2D Scale returns `[x,y]`, Opacity returns one number, and Source Text can return a string or a compatible text style object.
Property chain::`thisComp.layer('NAME').transform.position` targets a concrete layer in current comp. `effect('Slider Control')('Slider')` reads a specific effect control; effect renaming changes the referenced path.
Timing::`time` is seconds, `framesToTime(n)` converts frames at context rate, and `posterizeTime()` alters expression sampling. `loopOut()` normally requires suitable keyed motion.

Control interfaces::Expression Controls include Slider, Angle, Point, Color and other types. A readable named Slider like Swing Degrees is much easier to tune than hardcoded numbers across 12 expressions.
Reference correctly::Use the pick whip to generate exact effect/property paths. If a control is deleted or renamed unexpectedly, expressions can error and freeze or use fallback behavior.

Cold vs warm preview::The first pass calculates and caches frames. A replay may be far faster; changing a property can invalidate cached regions. Time only like-for-like comparisons.
RAM and cache::Memory preferences reserve RAM for other apps. Disk cache stores reusable intermediate frames on local storage; purging makes cached work disappear and may make the next playback slower.
Multiframe::When effects/plugins and resources permit, multi-frame rendering can render independent frames in parallel. Its gain depends on the shot, CPU, GPU, memory and media constraints.

Viewer vs memory::Green/blue cache indicators and preview panels tell you about cached ranges and conditions. Preview may re-render after color/render setting changes even when footage is unchanged.
Disk vs RAM::RAM cached frames are short-lived; persistent disk cache may survive a restart for eligible intermediates. The exact behavior depends on source/effect and cache settings.

recipe('logo-pulse','11 · Beat-reactive pulse','Audio','Drive scale from audio-derived keyframes.','''
Import an audio file and use Convert Audio to Keyframes.
Select a logo and add a 2D Scale expression referencing Audio Amplitude → Both Channels Slider.
Use a modest remap, e.g. `a=...; s=100+Math.min(20,a*1.5); [s,s];` with a valid pick-whip reference.
Preview with sound and observe peak reactions; smooth or cap peaks where needed.
Add a 10-frame opacity fade and export an audio-enabled review file.
''','Logo scales gently with the sound and never collapses during quiet segments.','Array dimensionality errors cause red expression warnings.')
recipe('depth-dolly','12 · Parallax from a still photograph','Tracking & 3D','Cut source artwork into near/mid/far planes.','''
Prepare a background image and two transparent foreground cutouts from the same photo.
Import each as a layer, enable 3D and spread them apart on the Z axis while preserving intended screen placement.
Create a camera and make a short lateral dolly/arc that reveals a depth difference.
Extend hidden background under the foreground silhouette to prevent holes.
Add subtle light/blur in the appropriate renderer and preview both camera extremes.
''','The foreground moves more than background without revealing empty cutout edges.','Scaling a single flat photograph is not real parallax.')
recipe('camera-dolly','13 · Simple camera orbit rig','Tracking & 3D','Use a Null as a stable camera pivot.','''
Create a comp with three 3D solids at different depths.
Create a 2-node camera and an appropriately positioned 3D Null.
Parent the camera to the Null and animate the Null’s Y rotation 0→30 degrees.
Adjust camera local Position so subject stays framed; verify target/Point of Interest behavior.
Render in the intended 3D renderer and compare to a Position-only camera move.
''','Subject remains readable while background layers show depth shift.','Incorrect pivot placement can make a camera orbit resemble uncontrolled zoom.')
recipe('noise-warp','14 · Heat haze with Displacement Map','Effects','Distort pixels using animated grayscale noise.','''
Make a comp-sized solid, apply Fractal Noise, choose a broad smooth scale and reduce contrast.
Animate Offset Turbulence slowly to make the map drift; precompose it as MAP_HEAT.
Apply Displacement Map to the target footage, point it to MAP_HEAT and adjust displacement strengths modestly.
Mask the effect region or use a matte so heat haze appears near a specific source.
Add small blur/color variation only where necessary; compare map on/off over time.
''','The background bends believably without an obvious repeating noise tile.','A color noise map may need channel selection to avoid chaotic displacement.')
recipe('depth-focus','15 · Depth-map-driven selective focus','Effects','Blur one region more than another.','''
Make a grayscale gradient with bright values in intended blurred regions.
Apply Camera Lens Blur to a duplicate of the footage and select the depth/blur map.

Create or track a mask path following the subject with as few stable vertices as possible.
Apply Generate → Stroke to a comp-sized solid and configure the path and width.
Precompose the stroke layer, duplicate it, blur one copy and add Glow to a duplicate.
Use a clean sharp core stroke above the soft bloom; tune opacities and blend modes.
Check motion frame by frame for outline detachment and edge aliasing.
''','One sharp line remains visible inside the blur, and outline follows subject motion.','A high blur on the only stroke layer produces a mushy and poorly defined outline.')
recipe('cloud-transition','17 · Procedural cloud transition','Effects','Combine noise, Levels and a matte reveal.','''
Create a solid with Fractal Noise and animate its Evolution/Offset Turbulence.
Use Levels to increase contrast so it evolves into a thresholded black/white matte.
Apply the resulting precomp as a Luma Matte to reveal the new scene over the old.
Animate Levels Input Black/White to turn a partial cloudy mask into full coverage.
Test consistency at full frame dimensions and inspect whether the mask reverses unintentionally.

recipe('rgb-split','18 · Controlled RGB channel split','Effects','Make an aberration effect using channel routing.','''
Precompose a source with correct alpha, then duplicate it into three layers.
Apply Shift Channels so each copy isolates red, green or blue, and combine with Add where appropriate.
Offset red slightly left and blue slightly right, leaving green centered.
Use a mask/adjustment where the effect should occur, rather than displacing the whole frame continuously.
Check seams, alpha and color clipping at Full resolution.
''','Aberration appears near high-contrast edges without introducing a giant invisible background.','With alpha artwork, additive recomposition can unintentionally alter transparency.')
recipe('particles-burst','19 · Native particle burst','Effects','A measured CC Particle World experiment.','''
Apply CC Particle World to a suitable comp-sized solid.
Set Birth Rate to a low visible rate and key it to 0 after the first 12 frames.
Set Longevity to about 2 seconds; choose a particle style and initial velocity and gravity.
Adjust emitter position so particles emerge from the logo center.

recipe('puppet-wave','20 · Puppet waving flag','Animation','A flexible loop from a static transparent flag.','''
Import a transparent flag shape and inspect its alpha edges.
Add Puppet pins at fixed pole edge and on two flowing sections of fabric.
Animate mid and tip pins across three poses over two seconds.
Use stiffness controls when necessary to avoid folding the pole itself.
Copy the first pose to the loop end and smooth all movements.
''','Flag waves smoothly and the pole edge stays visually stable.','Too many pins fight each other and create crumpling.')
recipe('content-fill','21 · Remove an object using Content-Aware Fill','Compositing','Generate a repair while retaining original footage.','''
Duplicate the clip and draw a mask around the unwanted object.
Animate/track mask and set its mode to create the intended transparent hole.
Open Window → Content-Aware Fill and choose suitable range and Fill Method.
Generate Fill Layer; inspect every frame and try a reference frame if textures are inconsistent.
Render and compare to source, particularly near moving occlusions and boundaries.
''','Object disappears without visible temporal pattern or seams.','Content-Aware Fill may give temporally unstable texture; a clean plate may work better.')
recipe('audio-cues','22 · Animate to beats with markers','Audio','Create rhythmic transitions without automatic beat-detection claims.','''
Import and listen to a clean WAV on Timeline; show waveform with LL.
Add comp markers manually at the actual beat transients.
Align keyframe entrances 2 frames before a beat or exactly on beat depending on intended impact.
Use F9 and Graph Editor to make 6-frame ease-out impacts and longer holds.
Export and listen to rendered sound, checking whether markers match perceptual onsets.
''','Every impact is perceptually synchronized in the exported movie.','Waveform peak amplitude is not always the perceived musical beat.')
recipe('json-score','23 · JSON-driven statistics title','Expressions & data','Load external numbers into Source Text.','''
Create a UTF-8 JSON file with a simple `{"team":"North","score":42}` object.
Import it into the project and create a Source Text expression using `footage('stats.json').sourceData.score` with a valid data path.
Convert the numerical result to a string, label it with a title and position it inside a shape card.
Use `sourceRectAtTime` to auto-size card background with 20 pixels of padding.
Change JSON to a longer team label and verify the design remains readable.
''','Values update after reloading external data and remain properly aligned.','Always check JSON syntax and exact field names.')
recipe('loop-remap','24 · Make a seamless time-remapped loop','Animation','Avoid a one-frame black or phantom-frame flash.','''
Import a visibly seamless 2-second clip into a 6-second comp.
Enable Time Remapping and inspect initial keyframes, especially end-duration key.
Set a key on the last valid frame and remove or correct the phantom duration-end key.
Add `loopOut('cycle')` expression to Time Remap and compare the repeated cycles frame by frame.
Check final frame and audio timing; Time Remap does not guarantee an inherently nonseamless source becomes seamless.
''','No unexpected blank, duplicate or jump frame at loop boundaries.','A mathematical loop cannot conceal mismatched first/last source artwork.')
recipe('alpha-delivery','25 · Transparent master and color check','Color & delivery','Deliver usable compositing assets.','''
Make a 48-frame comp with a moving semi-transparent circle over an empty comp background.
Choose Render Queue Output Module format/codec supporting alpha; set RGB+Alpha and appropriate alpha interpretation.
Render a lossless/near-lossless master or numbered PNG sequence with intentional color settings.
Import the result into a fresh comp over dark blue and hot pink backgrounds; inspect edge transparency.
Render a separate H.264 review file with a solid background; label it as a non-alpha review.
''','The alpha master has transparent edges, and the MP4 review is correctly labeled.','An .mp4 file may look like an alpha preview in AE but will not preserve ordinary transparency.')
recipe('project-handoff','26 · Collect Files handoff test','Color & delivery','Prove that your project is portable.','''
Save the final project with descriptive version and output names.
Choose File → Dependencies → Collect Files and create a fresh folder that contains the project and required footage.
Add a README of fonts, third-party effects, scripts, LUTs and manual configuration notes.
Move the collected folder to a different Windows directory and reopen its project file.
Render a tiny proof frame; confirm it matches the pre-collection output and uses the new source paths.
''','Project reopens from collected directory and produces identical proof frames.','Collect Files does not install fonts or purchase plugin licenses.')
recipe('capstone','27 · Final 10-second integrated sequence','Capstone','Practice the entire production pipeline with one coherent composition.','''
Create a 24-fps 10-second comp and organized project folders; establish color and output format.
Make a two-second alpha-matte animated title with a readable hold.
Add a three-card stagger using controlled easing and a Null; build one reusable editable title element.
Place either a tracked element or roto/keyed person over a short plate; inspect edges in motion.
Add a procedural 2-second transition and final text, synchronize audio, then render MP4 and an appropriate master.
Collect Files, reopen the collected project and write a self-critique of three improvements.
''','Both render and portable project exist, with no one-frame flashes or missing media.','A capstone is not complete until the collected source can be reopened.')

topic('source-time','Footage source time vs comp time','Foundations','Which source frame appears depends on interpretation, layer start, time stretch and remapping.', '''
Comp clock::The timeline CTI measures time in the active composition. A source clip's first visible frame may be offset if the layer has an adjusted start time, In/Out or stretch.
Remapped clock::Time Remap keys specify the source timestamp to sample at a comp time. A reverse or freeze segment changes footage source sampling without moving the layer bar.
Nested clocks::A precomp layer samples an inner composition time; frame rates may differ, and fractional times can be involved. Always compare displayed source and comp frame counts.

topic('frame-rate','Frame-rate conversion and temporal sampling','Foundations','Source FPS, composition FPS and output FPS are separate choices.', '''
Source interpretation::Interpret Footage defines assumed source rate for certain media. Changing this is not the same as placing a 30-fps clip in a 24-fps comp.
Sampling::Compositions evaluate frames at their own FPS and may repeat/drop/blend sources if frame rates differ. Frame blending and pixel motion can interpolate but may create artifacts.
Delivery::Choose an output frame rate intentionally and verify final frame count, audio sync and timecode before handoff.

topic('compositing','Layer-based compositing and image order','Compositing','Layers, alpha, mattes, blending and effects work together to produce pixels.', '''
Stack model::In ordinary 2D, higher layers cover lower layers depending on their opacity, alpha and blending mode. An adjustment layer uses composited lower pixels as its image input.
Opacity pipeline::Source alpha, masks, effects and track matte controls can combine to set final coverage. Inspect RGB and alpha separately to find errors.
Organizing passes::For demanding shots, work on source cleanup, segmentation/keying, track integration, grade, then finishing grain/sharpness. Nest only when it clarifies render order.
